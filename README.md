# PlacesApp

This App is showing a list of some specific places.
- [x] Each list item is a Place Object showing the name, the distance from the user's current location, and the type of the place, which is an icon.
- [x] If the user clicks on a list item, he will be directed to the Detailed View of this place object. Where he will see: 
- name
- type
- code
- address
- tags
- [x] If the user clicks the address the app will automatically open the phone maps with this particular address shown. 

- [ ] Last but not least the check-in button should be connected to the Bespot SDK which is not enabled at this moment. :tada:
